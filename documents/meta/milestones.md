know they exist_

## ✅ [ ] 1. Vulkan Breathes
- [ ] Create a Vulkan instance.
- [ ] Enumerate and list available physical devices (GPUs).
- [ ] Understand what an instance is and why it's needed.
- 🔍 *Proof:* GPU name is printed to the console.

---

## ✅ [ ] 2. The Window Appears
- [ ] Create a window using GLFW (or SDL2).
- [ ] Understand that Vulkan doesn’t handle windows.
- [ ] Make sure the window stays open and can be closed cleanly.
- 🔍 *Proof:* A resizable blank window appears on screen.

---

## ✅ [ ] 3. A Surface to Stand On
- [ ] Create a Vulkan surface from the window.
- [ ] Query supported surface formats and presentation modes.
- [ ] Understand what a surface is (bridge between window and Vulkan).
- 🔍 *Proof:* You print supported formats; no errors thrown.

---

## ✅ [ ] 4. GPU Ready
- [ ] Choose a physical device that supports the surface.
- [ ] Pick queue families (graphics + present).
- [ ] Create a logical device and retrieve `VkQueue`s.
- 🔍 *Proof:* Logical device created and queues retrieved.

---

## ✅ [ ] 5. The Swapchain Lives
- [ ] Create the swapchain for your window surface.
- [ ] Pick surface format, extent (resolution), and present mode.
- [ ] Create image views for each image in the swapchain.
- 🔍 *Proof:* Swapchain images and views created with no validation errors.

---

## ✅ [ ] 6. A Pipeline Is Forged
- [ ] Write simple vertex and fragment shaders (GLSL → SPIR-V).
- [ ] Create a render pass (single color attachment).
- [ ] Create a graphics pipeline using shaders, input layout, and viewport.
- 🔍 *Proof:* Pipeline and render pass successfully compiled.

---

## ✅ [ ] 7. The Triangle Rises
- [ ] Define vertex data for a simple triangle.
- [ ] Create a vertex buffer and transfer data to GPU.
- [ ] Record a command buffer that renders the triangle.
- [ ] Draw, submit, and present it.
- 🔍 *Proof:* A static triangle appears on screen.

---

## ✅ [ ] 8. The World Bends (Uniforms)
- [ ] Create a uniform buffer and descriptor set.
- [ ] Pass in a dynamic value like time or color.
- [ ] Update uniform data every frame.
- 🔍 *Proof:* The triangle changes color or moves over time.

---

## ✅ [ ] 9. Pixels That Pop (Textures)
- [ ] Load a 2D image into memory.
- [ ] Create a texture (VkImage) and upload data.
- [ ] Sample the texture in your fragment shader.
- [ ] Create a textured quad using UV coordinates.
- 🔍 *Proof:* A textured image is rendered correctly.

---

## ✅ [ ] 10. It Moves!
- [ ] Add input handling (keyboard, mouse).
- [ ] Modify vertex positions or uniforms based on input.
- [ ] Understand how rendering can be controlled in real time.
- 🔍 *Proof:* Something on screen reacts to you!
